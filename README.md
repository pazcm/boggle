Welcome to my Python project on Cloud9 IDE!

A basic sample web application was added to the
workspace, from the excellent Python tutorial _Learning Python the Hard Way_.


## Starting from the Terminal

To try the example application, type the following in the terminal:

```
cd ex50
python bin/app.py
```
